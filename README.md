# Data Structures and Algorithms Visualizer App

## How To Start The Project

To start the project open a terminal in the home directory of the project and run `npm run server` which will start the backend. Then open another terminal and run `npm run start`. This will start the client side of the project and you will be ready to go.

## Overview

This visualzer app aims to faciliate the process of visaulizing data structures and algrithems by allowing them to run real-time simulations. Users are further able to dynamically chnage the speed and input of the simulation so they can trace how it works.

This app will have support for:

- Sorting algorithms
  - Merge Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Quick sort
- Pathfinding Visualizer
- Graph Visualizer [stretch goal]
