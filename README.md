# Data Structures and Algorithms Visualizer App


## Overview

This visualzer app aims to faciliate the process of visaulizing data structures and algrithems by allowing them to run real-time simulations. Users are further able to dynamically chnage the speed and input of the simulation so they can trace how it works.

This app will have support for:
* Sorting algorithms 
    * Merge Sort
    * Bubble Sort
    * Insertion sort
    * Quick sort 
* Pathfinding Visualizer 
* Graph Visualizer [stretch goal]
